    <h5>My E-WheelAssistCare project is an electronic wheelchair initiative that integrates IoT (Internet of Things) to enhance accessibility and assistance for individuals with mobility challenges.</h5><br>
      <h3>üìå Project Overview</h3><br>
      <strong>E-WheelAssistCare</strong> is designed to provide smart mobility solutions for wheelchair users by incorporating electronic controls, automation, and assistive technology. The goal is to create a user-friendly, cost-effective, and accessible wheelchair that improves independence and ease of movement.
      <br> üöÄ Key Features <br>
      <h3>1. IoT Integration</h3> <br>
      <strong>Remote Control:</strong> Control the wheelchair using a smartphone app or voice commands. <br>
      <strong>  Bluetooth / Wi-Fi Module:</strong> Enables wireless communication for remote operation. <br>
      <strong>GPS Tracking:</strong> Helps locate the wheelchair in case of emergency. <br>
      <h3>2. Smart Navigation System</h3> <br>
      <strong>Obstacle Detection:</strong> Uses ultrasonic sensors to prevent collisions. <br>
      <strong>Path Optimization:</strong> AI-based assistance to choose the best path. <br>
      <h3>3. Automated Assistance</h3> <br>
      <strong>Self-Parking:</strong> The wheelchair can park itself when not in use. <br>
      <strong>Battery Monitoring:</strong> Displays battery health and alerts for low charge. <br>
      <h3>4. Safety & Security</h3> <br>
      <strong>Emergency SOS Button:</strong> Sends alerts to caregivers or emergency services. <br>
      <strong>Speed Control System:</strong> Adjusts speed based on terrain and obstacles. <br>
      <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack</h2> <br>
      <h3>1. Hardware Components</h3> <br>
      <strong>Microcontroller:</strong> Arduino or Raspberry Pi for processing. <br>
      <strong>Sensors:</strong> Ultrasonic, Infrared, and Gyroscope for navigation and safety. <br>
      <strong>Motors & Drivers:</strong> Stepper or DC motors with motor driver circuits. <br>
      <strong>Power Supply:</strong> Rechargeable lithium-ion battery. <br>
      <h3>2. Software & Programming</h3> <br>
      <strong>Embedded C / Python:</strong> For microcontroller programming. <br>
      <strong>Mobile App (Optional):</strong> Developed using Flutter / React Native for remote control. <br>
      <strong>Cloud Connectivity:</strong> Uses Firebase or MQTT for IoT communication. <br>
      <h2>üìÖ Project Phases</h2> <br>
      <h3>‚úÖ 1. Research & Design</h3> <br>
